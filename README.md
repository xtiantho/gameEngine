# gameEngine

This is a simple 3D Game Engine built with OpenGL and SDL2.

TODO:
- Create game object system (component based)
  - allow user to extend from base classes for their own components
  - would include the basics: a transform, and methods (update, input, render)
- implement heirarchical transforms
- rendering engine (optimize the lighting system)
- create a variety of primitive shapes (cubes, cylinders, planes, etc.)
- finish mesh loader (normals, texture coordinates)
- physics engine (collision detection!!)
- animation system
- sound?
